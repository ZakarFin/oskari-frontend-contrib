# Oskari frontend contrib

These are unofficial bundles for Oskari created by the Oskari community. Many of them add value to your Oskari install, but they are not as well maintained as the bundles under oskari-frontend.

## Using contrib bundles in your application

See the README on the sample-application repository on how to use these in an application or how to develop bundles in this repository.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute your own bundles to this repo, please make a Pull request. To make these easier to use and document version compatibility, each bundle _should_ have a README stating:
1. Which version of Oskari the bundle is compatible with (last developed with)
2. Who is the maintainer of the bundle (contact information) for example in case someone wants to update the functionality
